# Dreamlifter playground
Dreamlifter is the internal codename for Actions v2 - a major upgrade to bring powerful CI functionality to GitHub Actions.

This repo is a playground for all Hubbers to test out Actions v2. Feel free to create a branch and test things out!

## Sample project
This repo contains a sample NodeJS application taken from https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/pipelines-javascript.

A [.github/workflow][workflow-file] file has been set up in PR [#1][pr-1]. You can visit the PR and click Checks which will take you to the Actions tab.
You will see the result of the build and can click around.

You can also create your own branch and create your own PR.
